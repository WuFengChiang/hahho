# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 10/28/2025

Yahho日語跟讀 ("we," "us," or "our") respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy (this "Policy") describes the manner in which we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard information in connection with your use of the Yahho日語跟讀 mobile application (the "App"). By accessing or using the App, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agreed to the terms of this Policy. If you do not agree, you must refrain from using the App.

## 1. Information We Collect

We do not require users to create an account, nor do we collect or store any personally identifiable information on servers under our control. All processing is performed locally on your device.

- **Practice Records and Settings:** To provide shadowing progress tracking and course management features, relevant data is stored locally in Core Data on your device and does not leave your device.

Beyond the items described above, we do not access device information, usage analytics, approximate location data, or advertising identifiers. Any identifiers or data processed by third-party services (such as Google AdMob) are handled independently under their respective policies, as further described in Section 3.

## 2. Use of Information

Because we do not collect personal data, practice and course information is used solely to display your learning progress and preferences within the App on your device. Such information is not uploaded, shared, or used for marketing analytics.

## 3. Third-Party Services

We engage third-party software development kits (SDKs) or services to provide advertising and consent management. These partners may collect data independently of us. Our principal partner is:

- **Google AdMob SDK and User Messaging Platform (Google LLC):** These services deliver advertisements within the App and manage user consent. They may process advertising identifiers, coarse location data, and device information to serve contextual or non-personalized advertisements. For additional details, please review Google’s privacy policy: <https://policies.google.com/privacy>.

We do not have access to, nor do we control, the data collected by such third-party partners.

## 4. Tracking and Advertising Choices

We display only contextual (non-personalized) advertisements through AdMob. We do not enable cross-app tracking or personalized advertising. The App does not request the "Allow App to Track" permission, nor do we use your advertising identifier to build a personalized profile.

- You may review or adjust tracking settings for other apps via iOS Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking.
- To modify Google’s advertising preferences, please refer to the opt-out and control mechanisms provided by Google.

## 5. Data Retention

We do not maintain servers for storing user data. All practice records and settings remain on your device and are under your control. Deleting the App or erasing device data will remove all related information.

## 6. Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed to children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe we have inadvertently obtained such data, please contact us so that we can promptly delete it.

## 7. Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or object to the processing of personal information. To exercise these rights, please contact us using the information provided in Section 10.

## 8. Data Security

Data processed by the App remains on your device’s local storage and is protected by iOS native security features, including File Protection and Keychain safeguards. We do not store your information on external servers or cloud services. Resetting your device or deleting local data will permanently remove the related information.

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may amend this Policy from time to time. Any amendments will be posted at this URL with an updated effective date. Continued use of the App after such changes constitutes acceptance of the revised Policy.
